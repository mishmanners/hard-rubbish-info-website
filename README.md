# RePurposeful

Recycle, upcycle, or donate your unwanted items. This website provides users with search functionality to help them find the best way to correctly dispose of items. This will enable us to save rubbish from landfill and ensure we have a brighter and greener planet.

This website was originally built for a <a href="https://dev.to/challenges/github" target="blank">hackathon</a>.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Enter criteria to find specific disposal information.
- **Informational Pages**: Learn about hard rubbish and its disposal guidelines.
- **Contact Form**: Reach out with inquiries or feedback.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the search form on the search page to find information about specific items.
- Visit the about page for additional resources on hard rubbish disposal.
- If you have information you'd like to add to the website, please submit it through the online contact form.


## Next steps

TODOS:
- Connect the site to Netifly to handle the contact form
- Fetch data from external sources related to hard rubbish disposal and build out the database (currrently the search results are hard coded)

Future functionality:

In future, I'd love to build out the functionality of this website:

- **Web Scraping**: Fetch data from external sources related to hard rubbish disposal.
- **Login**: log in and track what items you are looking to get rid of.
- **Facebook plug-in**: to list the Facebook pages in the area that deal with hard rubbish.
- **Locality**: Build out the location data to include more council, states, and countries. Currently the wesbite is only showing information for Merri-Bek Council.
- **Leaderboard**: Track your items and collect points for items that you 'save' from hardrubbish; both as a "seller" and "buyer".
- **Connect with local businesses**: offer free advertising in return for products, discounts, or services that can be used as rewards; gamify the site.
